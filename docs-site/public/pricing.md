Read `LICENSE.md` before redistributing, modifying, or providing managed access to Codex Pooler. These docs describe self-hosted operation and do not publish a hosted or managed-service offer.

## Operator cost considerations

Codex Pooler documentation does not define subscription tiers or seat pricing. Operators should plan for their own infrastructure costs, database storage, Kubernetes or Docker hosting, monitoring, and any upstream provider account costs they are already authorized to use.

## Credential boundary

Codex Pooler does not replace upstream account authorization. Operate only accounts you are allowed to use, keep Pool API keys separate from operator MCP tokens, and do not put raw credentials or provider account material in docs, tickets, screenshots, logs, or prompts.

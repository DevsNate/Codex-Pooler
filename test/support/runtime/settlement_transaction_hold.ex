defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.SettlementTransactionHold do
  @moduledoc false

  # Holds the process that settles a request at a chosen point of its
  # settlement, through a `[:codex_pooler, :repo, :query]` handler that
  # matches the settling process's own statements (findings#288). The held
  # process reports `{hold, :held, pid, facts}` to the test and waits for
  # `{hold, :release}`, or releases itself after the detection budget. Only the
  # first match is held; `await_held!/1` registers the release on exit.
  #
  # `inside_transaction!/0` holds the first process that writes a turn's
  # completion inside a transaction after it inserted a settlement ledger
  # entry, right after that write: its transaction stays open and keeps every
  # row it locked, the codex session first. The settlement completes the turn
  # inside the request's own transaction, so nothing of it is visible while it
  # is held. It used to complete the turn in a second transaction, where the
  # same match holds that second transaction with the request already
  # committed.
  #
  # `after_commit!/2` holds the first process that commits a transaction in
  # which it wrote the given request's terminal status, right after that commit
  # and outside any transaction, and reports whether the same transaction wrote
  # a turn's completion. With `connection: true` the held process checks a
  # connection out first and keeps it until it is released, as a response task
  # does to publish what it settled (the interleaving of Drone 1865,
  # `OwnerCrashAfterSendScenario.kill_with_task_holding_connection!/5`).
  #
  # `after_rollback!/0` holds the first process that rolls back a transaction
  # in which it inserted a settlement ledger entry, right after that rollback
  # and outside any transaction.

  Waits until a resend's codex session lookup waits on the held settlement and
  returns the relation of the row it waits for.

  A websocket or native HTTP resend looks its codex session up by alias and
  locks the row, which the held settlement locked first; the wait shows as
  that lookup holding a tuple lock while it waits for the settler.
  `pg_stat_activity` pairs a live wait with the backend's status snapshot, so
  a sample whose statement is not that lookup is not the wait yet and is
  sampled again (findings#206 row 206-182). Other writers wait on the held
  rows too (a closed socket's delivery receipt on the attempt); only the
  lookup is the resend's. A cleanup that reached the same row first can
  stand between the resend and settler in PostgreSQL's lock queue, so follow
  the complete blocking chain. UNION deduplicates backend ids and terminates
  even if the sampled graph contains a cycle.

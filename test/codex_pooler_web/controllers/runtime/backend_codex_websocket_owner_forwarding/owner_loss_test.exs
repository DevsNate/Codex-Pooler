defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexWebsocketOwnerForwarding.OwnerLossTest do
  # An owner-forwarded socket whose websocket owner on its own node goes away
  # between two requests (findings#276). An owner that exits without crashing
  # (drained or stopped) took every response the client could anchor on with
  # its upstream connection: the idle native socket closes 1001 and the
  # client's next request goes out whole on a new socket, which takes the
  # session over and is served; a public `/v1` socket stays open and takes the
  # session over before its next request reaches an owner. Both used to stay
  # open and answer every later request `503 owner_unavailable` until the
  # client reconnected. An owner that crashed closes the idle socket 1011, as
  # before. The remote owner's arms are `remote_owner_loss_test.exs`.
  #
  # One node: the real public listener, owner forwarding on, the session's
  # owner on this node, the Pool's default serving mode, FakeUpstream; the
  # released client's native frames and a public `/v1` SDK request.

defmodule CodexPoolerWeb.Runtime.BackendCodexWebsocketOwnerForwarding.RemoteOwnerLossTest do
  # An owner-forwarded socket whose session's owner runs on the other node goes
  # on without it (findings#276), as production does whenever a turn lands on
  # the web pod that does not own its session. The socket never monitored a
  # remote owner, so after that owner went away (killed, its upstream
  # connection process killed, drained, stopped) every later request on the
  # socket met `503 owner_unavailable` in a few milliseconds, with no row and
  # nothing sent upstream, until the client reconnected; a new socket on the
  # session took it over and was served. Now the socket monitors the remote
  # owner and answers its exit as a local owner's: a crash closes the idle
  # socket 1011; any other exit closes an idle native socket 1001, so the
  # client's next request goes out whole on a new socket that takes the session
  # over, and leaves a public `/v1` socket open to take the session over before
  # its next request reaches an owner.
  #
  # Two BEAM nodes: this node runs the public listener and the sockets, a
  # second VM sharing the committed database runs the session's owner and its
  # provider connection (the module boots it once). Owner forwarding on, the
  # Pool's default serving mode, FakeUpstream; the released client's native
  # frames and a public `/v1` SDK request.
